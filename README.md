## Project Description
Analysing New York City Taxi Data with Spark /
Please upload the files in one ZIP on Moodle by X / 
Dataset / 
You can download the NYC taxi dataset from the link http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/ . /
However, it is huge. So, we have already prepared a sample, which you can find at this link. /
Each file row after the header represents a single taxi ride in CSV format. For each ride, we have some / 
attributes of the cab (a hashed version of the medallion number) as well as the driver (a hashed version /
of the hack license, which is what licenses to drive taxis are called), some temporal information about /
when the trip started and ended, and the longitude/latitude coordinates for where the passenger(s)
were picked up and dropped off.
We are mainly interested in each Trip's:
● Some Unique ID for the car (license)
● Pick-up location
● Pick-up time
● Drop-off location
● Drop-off time
Additionally, in the dataset archive, you will find a .geojson file that contains the geographical boundaries
of the different boroughs of New York City. This information is needed to compute the answers to the
queries needed on the data.
What do we need to compute?
First, we need to compute one important metric: utilization. Utilisation is the fraction of time that a cab
is on the road and is occupied by one or more passengers. One factor that impacts utilisation is the
passenger’s destination: a cab that drops off passengers near Union Square at midday is much more
likely to find its next fare in just a minute or two, whereas a cab that drops someone off at 2 AM on Staten
Island may have to drive back to Manhattan before it find its next fare.
We need to compute:
1. [Query 1] Utilization: This is per taxi/driver. This can be computed by computing the idle
time per taxi. We will elaborate on that more later.
2. [Query 2] The average time it takes for a taxi to find its next fare(trip) per destination
borough. This can be computed by finding the time difference, e.g. in seconds, between
the trip's drop off and the next trip's pick up.
3. [Query 3] The number of trips that started and ended within the same borough,
4. [Query 4] The number of trips that started in one borough and ended in another one
Suggested Steps
To carry out this analysis, we need to deal with two types of data that come up all the time: temporal
data, such as dates and times, and geospatial information, like points of longitude and latitude and
spatial boundaries.
As the data given in the taxi ride data set is giving just the longitude and latitude of both the pickup and
drop-off locations, we need to enrich this data set with boroughs of the respective locations. For this, we
are going to load another data set that specifies the boundaries of each borough in GeoJSON format,
data is supplied as a separate file. This data is relatively small. So, you can broadcast it to the different
workers. It can then be loaded as a JSON object and a dataframe can be created out of it.
To enrich the taxi ride data set with pick up and drop off borough names, we need to query the GeoJSON
data for the name of the borough for which the long/lat of the pick up /drop off belong. To achieve this
goal, we are going to use the geometry library shapely which provides Several APIs to handle geometric
shapes, among which to query about inclusion of shape in another shape.
You will need to enrich the GeoJSON record for each borough with its corresponding Shapely polygon
and for each long/lat of a pickup/drop off to convert to a Point object in the 2D space. It is
recommended to sort the GeoJSON data by polygon size in a descending order to guarantee faster
access as the borough with the largest area is expected to happen more frequently in the taxi ride
dataset. We can use the fact that the boroughCode property of each feature can be used as a sorting key,
with the code for Manhattan equal to 1 and the code for Staten Island equal to 5. Within the features for
each borough, we want the features associated with the largest polygons to come before the smaller
polygons, because most trips will be to and from the “major” region of each borough. Sorting the
features by the combination of the borough code and the area of each feature’s geometry should do the
trick.
To let Spark handle these, you need to define them as user-defined functions UDFs.
After we have put our raw data into the shape ready for analysis, we can proceed to capture our target.
However, we might need a cleansing step to exclude some outliers. Given the temporal nature of our trip
data, one reasonable invariant that we can expect is that the drop off time for any trip will be sometime
after the pickup time. We might also expect that trips will not take more than a few hours to complete,
although it’s certainly possible that long trips, trips that take place during rush hour, or trips that are
delayed by accidents could go on for several hours. We’re not exactly sure what the cutoff should be for
a trip that takes a “reasonable” amount of time. For this, we need to compute a new column "Duration"
which will be the difference between pickup time and drop off time. For this, we need to use the
unix_timestamp function to convert the date time of the respective times into milliseconds since epoch
time of Unix systems. We need that so we can treat the time as a numeric value and can do subtraction.
So that, the duration will be dropoff_ts - pickup_ts. After computing, we can drop records whose
duration is either negative or above a given threshold, say 4 hours, after converting them to
milliseconds.
Computing utilization
Now, getting back to the computation of utilization, we need to find the idle time of each driver (taxi) in
order to compute the utilization. For this, we need to sort the trips of each driver/taxi by their start time.
Before that we need to shuffle the data to guarantee that all trip records for the same driver will be
available on the same worker. After we shuffle and sort the data with time, we need to compare the
pickup time of record n with the drop off time of record n-1, except for the very first record. For this, we
need to use the Window operator of Spark. If the difference between a ride and its subsequent ride is
more than 4 hours, we ignore that as it represents a new session. Differences below 4 hours is
considered though as an idle time. At the end, we need to group by destination borough and sum the
idle time to address query 1.
The other three queries are much simpler and can be addressed once we enrich the data set with
start/end borough names.
